# C and Shell Exercises Repository - 42 Piscine

Welcome to my repository of exercises completed during the **42 Piscine**, an intensive one-month program at the 42 school. This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises focused on the C programming language and shell scripting, which were completed as part of this rigorous learning process.

## Repository Contents

### 1. C Programming
- **Day 01 to Day 10:** Introductory exercises in C, covering basic concepts such as data types, operators, control structures, and functions.
- **Day 11 to Day 15:** Intermediate projects including memory management, pointers, basic data structures (lists, arrays, etc.), and string manipulation.
- **Day 16 to Day 20:** Advanced projects covering sorting and searching algorithms, dynamic memory management, and the development of more complex programs.
- **Day 21 to Day 30:** Final projects, such as implementing a simple compiler or interpreter, and other projects that integrate the acquired knowledge.

### 2. Shell Scripting
- **Day 01 to Day 05:** Introduction to basic Unix commands and simple shell scripts.
- **Day 06 to Day 10:** More complex scripts including loops, conditions, and shell functions.
- **Day 11 to Day 15:** Task automation, file and process management, and development of command-line utilities.

## Peer-to-Peer Methodology

The 42 school's methodology is radically different from traditional education. Instead of having teachers, students learn through a peer-to-peer (P2P) methodology, which emphasizes collaborative learning and teamwork. Here are some key aspects:

1. **Active Learning:** Students are responsible for their own learning. They are expected to research, experiment, and find resources to solve problems.

2. **Peer Assessments:** Instead of traditional assessments, students review and evaluate each other's work. This not only helps reinforce their own learning but also fosters collaboration and communication.

3. **Projects and Challenges:** Rather than exams, students work on practical projects and challenges that require applying acquired knowledge to solve real-world problems.

4. **No Teachers:** There are no classes or teachers. Students learn through online resources, books, official documentation, and primarily with the help of their peers.

5. **Full Immersion:** The "Piscine" is an intensive one-month period where students dedicate long hours to programming, preparing for the rigor of the full 42 course.
